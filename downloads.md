##Firmament Source
Firmament is licensed under the GPL v3. Feel free to use it for your open-source projects. Please contact [Jordan](mailto:jordan@wambaugh.org) about commercial licensing options.

Please keep in mind that Firmament is currently in alpha stages and is heavily under development. Things change every day, and are certain to be broken at times.


###Requirements
To use firmament, you will need a Haxe NME development environment. You can download the full setup from the [Haxe NME Download page](http://www.haxenme.org/download/).

###Haxelib
The recommended (and easiest) way to get your hands on Firmament is through Haxelib, the haxe package manager. All you need to do is, after installing Haxe NME (see above), run this in a command prompt:

	haxelib install firmament

And that's it! Haxelib should take care of the rest, and even install any prerequisite haxe libraries automatically.

If you later want to update firmament, just run this:

	haxlib upgrade

and haxelib will automatically upgrade firmament and everything else.

You can also take a look at the [firmament haxelib page](http://lib.haxe.org/p/firmament) for release notes and more.


###Github
For those who like to live on the bleeding edge, you can download the firmament engine source code from github here:

##Firmament Editor
There is now an editor under development to make developing maps easier than ever for Firmament. The editor can be built from the source on github, or you can get binaries here.
