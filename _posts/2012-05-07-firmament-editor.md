This past weekend I put in a LOT of hours working on firmament, and especially, the new Firmament Editor. It's still a little rough, especially since I had to write all the UI code from scratch, but it works!

You can get it from the [Downloads Page](downloads.html).


In addition, Firmament is now available on haxelib! Check out the [haxlib page](http://lib.haxe.org/p/firmament) or run 

	haxelib install firmament

To check it out!
