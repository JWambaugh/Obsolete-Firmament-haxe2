Development on Firmament Version 2.0 is well under way! If you are tracking us on github, you will have noticed that the Version 2 Alpha branch has been moved to master, with the 1.0 code moved over to a 1.0 branch.

The following changes have already been implemented for version 2.0 and are available immediately:

* Entity Component System - The entity system has been completely overhauled with an extremely powerful component sysyem to allow you to customize the behavior of entities by attaching simple components to them. 
* Tilesheet Animation System - Create animations to your hearts content without sacrificing performance with the flexible new built-in animation system.
* Fully updated map editor

The changes in Firmament 2.0 break compatibility with 1.0, so some work will be required to convert your packages over. But the gains from switching to 2.0 should definitely be worth it!
